<h2>About</h2>
<p>Welcome to MusicGamez, bringing smarts to your rhythm games.</p>
<h3>What is this?</h3>
<p>MusicGamez is a tool to help you find maps for your favorite rhythm game. MusicGamez matches game levels to <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/">MusicBrainz</a> metadata, and uses the in-depth knowledge from MusicBrainz to group maps by artist, label, genre, license, and more. At a glance you can see all of the maps for any musical piece and whether it's safe to play on stream. You can use the <a href="{{ url_for('main.genres') }}">Browse</a> page to find maps in your favorite genre, the <a href="{{ url_for('main.lookup') }}">Lookup</a> tool to quickly find a map's stream-safety and where you can buy the song online, and the <a href="{{ url_for('main.mycollection') }}">My Collection</a> tool to find rhythm maps of songs that you already know.
<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>For all of the games MusicGamez supports, the website is checked every hour for new and updated maps. When a new one comes in, we first check to see if the title and artist that the uploader gave matches anything in our database. If not, it is added to a queue to be automatically fingerprinted using <a href="https://acoustid.org/">AcoustID</a> technology. This fingerprint identifies the sound of that particular recording, which can then be more specifically matched to an entry in the MusicBrainz database. After the recording has been identified, all further information—artists, labels, cover art, links—comes from the MusicBrainz database.<p>
<h3>What do the little icons mean?</h3>
<p>The indicators in the top-right of a recording in a list are there to signal how safe a map is to play on livestreaming services such as Twitch.tv or YouTube. <strong>Please note</strong> that this signal is <em>not</em> a guarantee, and MusicGamez claims no responsibility for issues caused as a result of playing any maps linked from this site. MusicBrainz is a community-built database, and could have errors. Always click through to see specific terms, always respect the wishes of the artist, always follow local copyright laws, and always exercise caution.<p>
<ul class="fa-ul">
<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-creative-commons" aria-hidden="true"></i> <b>Creative Commons:</b> Safest. The music has been released under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> license, which are designed to promote the sharing of knowledge and creativity. Click through to see which specific license and its terms: some require that any derivative work (i.e., your stream) carry the same license, some require that no derivatives may be commercial (i.e., no monetization), and almost all of them require credit be given to the original creator.</li>
<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-television" aria-hidden="true"></i> <b>Permission given:</b> Safe. The music artist or label has given explicit permission to play their music as part of a gaming stream. Be sure to click through for terms anyway: most artists require that you at least give credit, some labels have licensing programs that you have to be a part of, and sometimes the permission only extends to certain albums. Unlike the rest of the data on MusicGamez, streaming permission links are from <a href="">PartyBus's spreadsheet</a> and <a href="https://creatorhype.com/stream-music/">creatorhype.com</a>.</li>
<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-file-text-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> <b>License available:</b> Sometimes safe. MusicBrainz has licensing information available for this track, but it isn't a license that MusicGames recognizes. Click through to see what it is.</li>
<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-circle-thin" aria-hidden="true"></i> <b>Not published under a label:</b> Sometimes safe. This icon means that, according to MusicBrainz, every release of this track has been a <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/label/157afde4-4bf5-4039-8ad2-5a15acc85176">"no-label"</a> release. That can either mean that it was self-published, it was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_label">"white label"</a> release, or it otherwise had "no label." If it was self-published, it is less likely to be included in automated content-identification systems, but the artist still reserves all copyrights.</li>
</ul>
<h3>There's an issue with the data</h3>
<p>One great aspect of <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/">MusicBrainz</a> is that it is all open data, available for anyone to edit. So sign up for an account, and fix it yourself! On the page for a recording or artist, you can click the title or the artist's name, respectively, to be taken to the MusicBrainz page and edit from there. Be mindful that, being a global, community project, MusicBrainz has some <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Style">style guidelines</a> that you need to follow, to keep everything consistent. Sometimes what you consider a mistake may just be a difference in style!</p>
<h3>My map isn't showing up</h3>
<p>First of all, MusicGamez only refereshes every hour, so be patient and wait for at least that long before checking that it appears here. If it still doesn't show up where you expect, you can use the <a href="{{ url_for('main.lookup') }}">Lookup</a> tool to enter the ID of your map to find the status it's in. If you want to make sure that your map matches correctly, look up the recording you used on MusicBrainz beforehand, and make sure that the title and artist on your map exactly match what MusicBrainz has. Additionally, try to make minimal edits so that the fingerprint closely matches the original recording.</p>
<h3>My map is still stuck—what do "processing," "no match," and "too many matches" mean?</h3>
<p>These are the technical terms for the part of the matching process that the map is in. "Processing" either means that it was just added to the database and needs to be checked for equally-named recordings, or that the acoustic fingerprint is being calculated and looked up. "No match" means that, even after generating a fingerprint, MusicBrainz found no matching recordings—if you own a digital copy of the recording, use <a href="https://picard.musicbrainz.org/">MusicBrainz Picard</a> with the original audio files to submit your fingerprints. "Too many matches" means that the AcoustID fingerprint database has multiple recordings associated with that fingerprint, sometimes just because it's a popular song and has been remastered many times, or sometimes because of alternate edits that are too close to the original—MusicGamez will hopefully soon get a feature to resolve these.</p>
<h3>I represent an artist or label and I have an issue with my property on your site</h3>
<p>First of all, please understand that MusicGamez does not host any audio files! If your objection is with the music hosted on the games' websites, please click through to the site and then contact them for removal. If your objection is with how your property is represented, please see the above point about fixing data issues on MusicBrainz. If your objection is specifically with the "stream permission" icon, first contact our suppliers of that data (see above about the "Permission given" icon) to have it changed, and then let us know so we can update it on our end. Finally, if there is some other that needs to be resolved, please contact us through GitHub and we can work something out.</p>
<h3>Privacy</h3>
<p>MusicGamez does not currently store any data about its visitors. It uses browser cookies for two core features: filter settings, and account credentials for My Collection. MusicGamez does not include any third-party trackers. However, these terms are subject to change at any time (in particular, account credential storage may need to change), so please check this page regularly for updates.</p>
